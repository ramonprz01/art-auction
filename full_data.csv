(For his explanation of this system, see v.2, p. vii). Therefore caution must be exercised when his catalogue numbers are given as pedigree for Saint-Aubin works.

The Bibliothèque nationale in Paris owns Dacier's personal copy of his catalogue, which he continued to update and annotate until shortly before his death. An American scholar, Kim de Beaumont, transcribed these annotations. A copy of her transcriptions is in the Frick Art Reference Library in New York."
